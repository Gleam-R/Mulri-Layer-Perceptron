A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is a class of artificial neural networks (ANNs) that form the foundation of many machine learning applications, particularly in supervised learning tasks.
An MLP is composed of multiple layers of nodes, each of which is fully connected to the nodes in the preceding and succeeding layers. 
These layers typically include an input layer that receives the data, one or more hidden layers where computations are performed, and an output layer that delivers the final result.
Each node (or neuron) in the network processes its input by applying a weighted sum followed by an activation function, such as ReLU, sigmoid, or tanh, to introduce non-linearity into the model. 
This non-linear mapping enables MLPs to learn and approximate complex relationships between input and output data. 
 MLPs are trained using backpropagation, an algorithm that adjusts the weights and biases of the network through gradient descent, minimizing a defined loss function. 
 The versatility and power of MLPs make them suitable for a wide range of applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, financial forecasting, and more. 
 However, they may require extensive computational resources and hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal performance.
 MLPs are a fundamental concept in deep learning and serve as a stepping stone to more advanced architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
